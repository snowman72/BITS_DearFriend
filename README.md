## Features

### 1. Authentication and Profile Management

### 2. Object Recognition with Text Recognition
üëÅÔ∏è One of DearFriend's standout features is its Object Recognition and Text Recognition capabilities, powered by the **MobileNetV2 Apple ML model**. Users can point their devices at objects or text, and the system identifies them, announcing the object's name or reading the text aloud using Text-to-Speech technology. These features reduce the need for external assistance, promoting independence in daily tasks such as identifying objects or reading labels.

### 3. Emergency Alert
üö® The Emergency Alert system is designed to assist visually impaired users in critical situations. By activating the alert, users can send their IP address and location details to a pre-set emergency contact via text message. The system automatically retrieves the user‚Äôs location and sends it to the contact‚Äôs phone number, ensuring a quick response during emergencies.

### 4. Volunteer Video Call System
üìû A core feature of DearFriend is the Volunteer Video Call system, which connects users with volunteers for real-time assistance. Volunteers can guide users through tasks such as reading labels, navigating spaces, or identifying objects via video. The video call interface is designed to be simple and accessible, ensuring ease of use for visually impaired users.
